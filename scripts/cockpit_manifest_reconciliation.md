# Cockpit manifest reconciliation (FLEET_TMUX_LAUNCH_1, join v1.3.2 / #12093)

> GENERATED artifact — do not hand-edit. Reconcile-to-exactly-one: a profile
> resolves iff its literal BAKER_ROLE/FORGE_TERMINAL markers (≤1 wrapper hop,
> NO cwd parsing) map to exactly one registry slug. Zero/conflict/multiple =
> unresolved -> fix that seat's zsh function markers at source, never a table.
