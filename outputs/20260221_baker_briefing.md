## DAILY BRIEFING — February 21, 2026

### 1. TOP ALERTS (Tier 1 = Urgent)

| Tier | Alert | Action |
|------|-------|--------|
| 🔴 **1** | **Hotel Revenue Shortfall — ~€1M for 2026** | Rolf flagged €870K Feb-Apr shortfall. Need revised cost plan and cash flow model. Balazs (normally builds this) is sick. |
| 🔴 **1** | **Hayatt Deal — Urgent Priority, Low Visibility** | Discussion triggered between DV and Andrey but next steps unclear. Constantinos was building scenarios. No resolution visible in recent data. |
| 🟡 **2** | **AO/RG7 Investment — Document Trail Still Open** | Anna's team requested docs in November. Constantinos managing. Three months is long — creates legal exposure if not closed. |
| 🟡 **2** | **RG7 Hagenauer Final Account — Excel File Access Live** | Christine Sähn delivered Box link Feb 19. Dennis downloading. File needs competent review before next steps. |
| 🟡 **2** | **Balazs Csepregi — Sick and Partially Offline** | 39°C+ fever since Feb 18. Single point of failure across RG7 modeling, Cupial, hotel analysis. |
| ⚪ **3** | **Siegfried Bank Meeting — Debrief Pending Next Week** | Unavailable until next week. Schedule debrief when back. |

### 2. ACTIVE DEALS & PROJECTS

**RG7 Hagenauer (Schlussabrechnung)**
- Final account settlement process active. Christine Sähn (Hagenauer PM) shared the live Excel file via Box on Feb 19.
- Dennis handling download/access logistics.
- Settlement methodology outlined in the RG7 Hagenauer Final Account system — Excel workbook is the working data layer.
- Key risk: Need to cross-reference Christine's file with Brisen's own calculations before engaging on numbers.

**Hotel (Kuppel-Ahl)**
- Revenue shortfall confirmed by Rolf: €870K gap Feb-Apr, annualizing to ~€1M for 2026.
- October's forecast assumed July positive cash flow — this assumption is now broken.
- Cost adjustment plan initiated but timeline unclear. Rolf is under pressure.
- Balazs normally builds the financial model — his illness compounds the problem.

**Hayatt/Andrey**
- Priority deal but operational detail is thin. DV met with Andrey (context: Mandarin hotel). Constantinos was working on structuring scenarios.
- Next step unclear — this needs a direct check-in or someone to surface the current status.

**Cupial**
- Data/reconciliation workstream. Balazs is the lead analyst. His illness creates a delivery risk.
- Edita appears to be involved on the operational side — a step forward but the process needs Edita to provide clear direction.
- Legal: Alric Ofenheimer.

**CEO Cockpit**
- Infrastructure operational: Scan Engine v1 running, State File live, Morning Briefing deployed, 101 known contacts indexed.
- 9 sources scanned with signal classification working.
- This briefing is itself a product of the system.

**RE Pipeline / KitzKempi**
- Origination stage. UBM/AMBO 50/50 ownership, property underinvested, owners may sell. In radar mode — no action triggers detected.

### 4. RG7 INVESTOR PIPELINE

From ClickUp, your investor/introducer funnel shows:
- **Biting prospects:** Dzen, Balazs (investor capacity), Christophe Buchwalder, Alister
- **To-do prospects:** Dayan Brothers
- **Active introducers:** Hiroo Investors, Dariga N.
- **Capital source:** Zhannat

The Feb 4 meeting transcript suggested nobody has signed a contract in 2025 — described as a "hard workout project." If this is still true, the investor pipeline needs a forcing mechanism or the fundraise timeline slips further.

### 5. EMERGING PATTERNS & RISKS

1. **Balazs as single point of failure.** He touches too many critical workstreams. His illness exposes a bench-depth problem. Consider interim assignments for his top 2-3 deliverables.

2. **Hotel cash flow assumption is broken.** The July positive cash flow target from October's forecast is almost certainly no longer valid with a €1M revenue shortfall. You need Rolf's revised cost plan AND a revised cash flow model — which normally Balazs would build.

3. **AO/RG7 document chain is three months old.** Anna's team first requested docs in November. Constantinos has been managing but the trail suggests slow progress. If AO's investment structure isn't cleanly documented, it creates legal exposure.

4. **No contracts signed in RG7 investor pipeline (as of Feb 4).** Multiple biting prospects but zero conversions. Either the terms need adjusting, the process needs accelerating, or the market signal is telling you something.

### 6. RECOMMENDED PRIORITIES TODAY

1. **Get Rolf's cost adjustment plan on a deadline** — ask for a revised P&L with cost cuts by end of next week.
2. **Clarify Hayatt next steps** — who owns it, what's the timeline, what's blocking.
3. **Assign Balazs backup** — at minimum for the Hagenauer settlement review and hotel cash flow remodel.
4. **Ping Constantinos on AO document status** — three months is too long for an investor's document request.
5. **Review Hagenauer Box file** — Dennis is downloading; make sure someone competent reviews before next week.
